    abstract = { This paper describes a mechanism which has six degrees of freedom, controlled in any combination by six motors, each having a ground abutment. It is considered that by its particular arrangement, this mechanism may form an elegant design for simulating flight conditions in the training of pilots. Unlike most simulators, it has no fixed axes relative to the ground, and therefore within the limits of amplitude of the design it can truly simulate the conditions of banking by carrying the simulation of control surfaces into the axes of the new attitude.Variations in control arrangements are described and their respective design merits considered.Other possible uses for this mechanism are mentioned, including automation of production. }
